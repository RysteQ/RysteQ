<h1 align = "center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am RysteQ !</h1>

<br>

Hello, I am a hobbyist programmer that enjoys linux a bit *too* much in all reality. At the moment I study Applied Informatics in my university and do random things from time to time, you can see them by yourself because they are my GitHub repositories.

<br>

The programming languages I enjoy the most are:

- C
- C#
- Java
- Python
- x86 Assembly
