# Hi there, I am RysteQ ! 👋 

Hello, I am a hobbyist programmer that enjoys linux a bit *to* much in all reality. At the moment I study for my degree in Applied Informatics at my university and do random things from time to time, you can actually see those random things of mine by yourself because a decent portion of them are my GitHub repositories !!!
